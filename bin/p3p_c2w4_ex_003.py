#Below, weâ€™ve provided a for loop that sums all the elements of list1. Write code that accomplishes the same task, but instead uses a while loop. Assign the accumulator variable to the name accum.

list1 = [8, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]

#tot = 0
accum=0
counter=0

#for elem in list1:
#    tot = tot + elem
while counter<len(list1):
    accum+=list1[counter]
    counter+=1
print(accum)
print(counter)

#1. You will be sorting the following list by each elementâ€™s second letter, a to z. Create a function to use when sorting, called second_let. It will take a string as input and return the second letter of that string. Then sort the list, create a variable called sorted_by_second_let and assign the sorted list to it. Do not use lambda
ex_lst = ['hi', 'how are you', 'bye', 'apple', 'zebra', 'dance']
def second_let(some_list):
    tmp_lst=[]
    for word in some_list:
        tmp_lst.append(word[1])
    return tmp_lst

sorted_by_second_let=sorted(second_let(ex_lst))
print(sorted_by_second_let)

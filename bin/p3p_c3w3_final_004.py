# Your next task will be to fetch data from OMDB. The documentation for the API is at https://www.omdbapi.com/
#
# Define a function called get_movie_data. It takes in one parameter which is a string that should represent the title of a movie you want to search. The function should return a dictionary with information about that movie.
#
Again, use requests_with_caching.get(). For the queries on movies that are already in the cache, you wonâ€™t need an api key. You will need to provide the following keys: t and r. As with the TasteDive cache, be sure to only include those two parameters in order to extract existing data from the cache.

import requests_with_caching
import json
def get_movie_data(movie_name):
    baseurl = "http://www.omdbapi.com/"
    params_diction = {}
    params_diction["t"] = movie_name
    params_diction["r"] = "json"
    omdb_resp = requests_with_caching.get(baseurl, params = params_diction)
    return omdb_resp.json()


# some invocations that we use in the automated tests; uncomment these if you are getting errors and want better error messages
# get_movie_data("Venom")
# get_movie_data("Baby Mama")
